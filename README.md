# 404-Page-Design
A simple 404 Error Page Design.

**Feel free to use this code. No need credits.**

## Implementation
***Implementing the 404 page on your website.***

First, either download/use the 404 page I created (css file included) or create your own. 
Then, create a **.htaccess** file. Just keep the ".htaccess" extension. Do not rename it to anything else.

Insert this code into your **.htaccess** file:
```
ErrorDocument 404 /404-page.html
```
***NOTE: Do not put anything in the .htaccess file unless you know what you are doing.***

**Save the .htaccess file in your root file of your website. And you're ready to go!**
